# AstroData
Astronomic data, all in one place.

This project is an attempt to recreate a lot of the functionality of the recently shut down website calsky.com. The goal is to implement as much of the functionality of that website as possible while completely revamping the visual appearance while making the data the center of everything. The visuals are supposed to aid the display of the data in the best way possible, not to hinder it.
The plan is to calculate as many of the respective values by ourselves so we don't rely on other services to keep running. If we have to use third-party data, we want to make sure it's open source and freely usable without restrictions.
